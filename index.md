Hey! I'm a software engineer, team lead, architect and emerging technology researcher. I've built, designed and run backend services, tools, web sites and prototypes. Currently focused on [C2PA](https://c2pa.org/) and [Project Origin](https://www.originproject.info/) - an open media provenance specification for the internet, as well as analysis of emerging technologies such as VR & AR, both at [the BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk).

I love space, boardgames, and rhinos.
